// Pseudocode for SPI peripheral initialization

// Initialize MCU GPIO pins for SPI
Configure SCK pin as OUTPUT
Configure MOSI pin as OUTPUT
Configure MISO pin as INPUT
Configure SS (Slave Select) pin as OUTPUT (optional if master)

// Configure SPI Control Registers
Set SPI mode (e.g., Master or Slave)
Set clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA)
Set data order (MSB or LSB first)
Set SPI clock speed (baud rate)

// Enable SPI Peripheral
Enable SPI module
Enable interrupts (if needed)

// Initialize Associated Peripherals (e.g., sensors or devices)
Initialize sensor/device-specific settings
Set any required configuration options

// Main Program Loop
In the main loop, you can perform SPI transactions as needed.
For example, to send data:
Select the target device by setting SS (if it's a master)
Load data into the transmit buffer
Wait for SPI transmission to complete (if using interrupts)
Handle received data (if needed)

// Cleanup (optional)
Disable SPI and associated interrupts (if no longer needed)
Restore GPIO pins to their default state (if needed)
